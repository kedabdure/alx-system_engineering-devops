# Expert Handyman Services Downtime Report

## Issue Summary
Recently, the Expert Handyman Services platform encountered a significant outage, leading to 500 errors across all platform routes. This resulted in a complete service shutdown, affecting 85% of our user base. The primary cause was identified as a database connection pool exhaustion. The outage lasted from March 15, 2024, at 09:00 AM to March 15, 2024, at 01:00 PM (East Africa Time, Ethiopia).

## Timeline
- The issue was first identified on March 15, 2024, at 09:00 AM (East Africa Time, Ethiopia) when our monitoring system detected a spike in error rates.
- By 09:15 AM, the on-call engineering team disconnected the affected server for further analysis and redirected all traffic to a backup server.
- Initial investigations started at 09:30 AM, focusing on the database performance and connection logs.
- By 11:00 AM, it was confirmed that the outage was due to all available database connections being consumed, leaving none for new requests.
- Further investigation revealed that an unoptimized query was causing a bottleneck, leading to a rapid consumption of available connections.
- At 12:00 PM, the problematic query was optimized, and additional database connections were provisioned.
- By 01:00 PM, normal service was restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the outage was the exhaustion of the database connection pool due to an unoptimized query that consumed a significant amount of resources. The resolution involved optimizing the problematic query to reduce its resource usage and provisioning additional database connections to handle peak loads more effectively.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent future occurrences, we plan to implement a more efficient query optimization process and conduct regular performance reviews of all critical database queries. We will ensure that our database connection pool is adequately sized to handle peak traffic and implement automated scaling solutions to adjust resources dynamically. Enhanced monitoring systems will be deployed to track database performance and connection usage closely, allowing for early detection of potential issues. We will also introduce additional backup strategies to maintain service availability during any future problems. Comprehensive documentation and team training will be conducted to ensure swift and efficient responses to similar issues in the future.

These measures are designed to enhance the reliability and uptime of the Expert Handyman Services platform, ensuring that our services remain consistently available to all users.
